### Stretch Goals TO DO
- Play with the gravity level, velocity changes, and game speed. Notice how different values can radically change the feel of the game.
- add graphics for the walls and dragon.
- Consider making the graphics bigger and the overall play area smaller
- Investigate bracket-lib’s “flexible console” and change the player coordinates to floating-point numbers for smoother movement.
- Add color and visual flair to the menus.
- Try animating the dragon. https://opengameart.org/content/flappy-dragon-sprite-sheets
