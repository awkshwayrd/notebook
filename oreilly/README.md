#### Live - Mastering threads

Thread Blocked state only shows when using synchronised to get moitor lock not for the Lock classes

Waiting is used during e.g. RenetrantLock

Wait is used when waiting for some condition so you give up the lock on the monitor object

Prefer notifyAll() over notify()

`while(!precondition) lock.wait();`

Lock.wait() doesn't complete until it reacquires the lock

#### Live - Fundamentals of Learning: Learn faster and better using neuroscience

###### Menmonic for learning

**I asked**  *quiz self*

**for a mixed-** *Mix different material*

**up**  *Go to diffuse, back to focus, then diffuse etc.*

**nap break** *Take lots of naps and breaks to cement learning*

**at several Starbucks** *different venues*

**associations**  *connect material with as many associations as possible*

It is normal for your brain to throw information away fter a trial period. So **Don't cram!**

Pre-test *before* you start learning

Focus - what exactly is this thing in front of me? Diffuse - What's going on here in general?

It is very imp. to switch between the 2. Use diffuse to determine what to focus on.

Procrastination is good if you use it to iterate but finish before the deadline. *Start early and finish late.*

Any way to show facts in positive light for listeners will greatly help acceptance.

Simulate the Monty Hall Problem Using Python https://medium.com/swlh/simulate-the-monty-hall-problem-using-python-7b76b943640e

Understanding the Monty Hall Problem https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-monty-hall-problem/

Binomial distribution - given a target probability of success, calculates the probability of getting x success out of y attempts. e.g. given 90% success probability what is the chance of getting 8 sucesses out of 10 attempts?

Beta distribution - consider all probabilities of success, how likely each one is to getting x success out of y attempts. e.g. how likely is each z probability of success to give 8 sucesses out of 10 attempts? Calculated by area under curve. alpha is no. of successes, while beta is no. of failures. This helps to track if more sample collection is a good idea.

#### Interactive - Necessary Statistics in Finance

Measures of central tendency is a summary statistic by which we get a certain sense about the distribution of population sample subset  data.

The central tendency measures are:

- Mean (or average)
- Median
- Mode

```
pip install statistics
```

numpy, pandas

Dispersion informs us of the extent to which the distribution is dispersed or stretched. Three dispersion measures are:

- Variance - defines how each value differs from the central tendency and how each value differs from another. calculated by the sum of the squares of the difference of each data point to the average divided by one minus the number of observations.
- Standard error - gives us a sense of dispersion of the population. also commonly known as error margin
- Standard deviation - square root of the variance

#### Interactive - Tools Used in Finance and Python

Regression analysis requires a dependent variable with continuous variables and one or more independent variables. 

```
pip3 install statsmodels
```

to check the existence of multicollinearity, we have two methods at our disposal: correlation matrix and variance inflation factor (VIF). 

a correlation coefficient larger than 80% leads to multicollinearity.

greater than 5 VIF values again implies multicollinearity.

Gauss-Markov assumptions should be satisfied. We need to visit six assumptions:

- Linearity of the coefficients
- Constant variance (homoscedasticity)
- Low multicollinearity
- Uncorrelated error terms
- Independent variables should not be correlated with the errors
- The error term should, on average, be zero

#### Interactive - Time Value of Money and Python Implementation

Net present value, NPV deals with the comparison of project cost and cash inflows. all costs incurred and all cash inflows generated over time are discounted back to present day so that an investor can easily decide if the project is feasible. Discounting back the future cash flow can be done via discount rate, which is a compensation for the risk assumed throughout the investment period.  "discount rate" refers to the interest rate that bridges between the present and future value of money.

> Cash Flow at time 0/(1+discount rate)ˆ0+Cash Flow at time 1/(1+discount rate)ˆ1+...+Cash Flow at time n/(1+discount rate)ˆn

The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate resulting in a zero NPV. defined as a discount rate that equals the NPV of an investment project to zero. 

> Cash Flow at time 0/(1+IRR)ˆ0+Cash Flow at time 1/(1+IRR)ˆ1+...+Cash Flow at time n/(1+IRR)ˆn

- If IRR > cost of capital, accept the investment
- If IRR < cost of capital, reject the investment

#### Interactive - Introduction to Vector Algebra Using Python

vectors are points in a finite-dimensional space which can represent numeric data.

Numpy is a numeric computing library for Python that provides support for multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with associated mathematical functions. Numpy arrays can be represented as vectors.

A vector is called a zero vector if all of its elements are 0.

Matplotlib is a data visualization library for Python that can be used to visualize vectors.

Matplotlib offers quiver plot to plot vectors. Quiver plot accepts the location and directions of the vectors as its parameters.

###### Declarative application management in Kubernetes

https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/declarative-application-management.md

A Python framework to write Kubernetes operators in just a few lines of code

https://github.com/nolar/kopf

#### Interactive - Kubernetes Extensibility: Develop an Operator with Kubebuilder

Similar to the official Kubebuilder example

After defining the types in Go

```
make manifests
```

```
kubectl kustomize config/crd | kubectl apply -f -
```

In the kubebuilder boilerplate there is an `install` task in the Makefile with a slightly older version of using kustomize. Now, kustomize is built into kubectl.

Get a time 2 minutes from now

```
date -d "$(date --utc +%FT%TZ) + 2 min" +%FT%TZ
```

Example Kubernetes controller: the cloud native at command https://github.com/programming-kubernetes/cnat

Contains examples to build operator from client-go, kubebuilder, and operator-sdk

#### Interactive - Kubernetes Container: Spring Boot to Kubernetes

https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/twuni/docker-registry

pure Kubernetes docker-registry

Use a gradle build in a multi-stage Dockerfile for build

Use the `envsubst` command to replace the environment variables

```
envsubst < hello.yaml > hello-resolved.yaml
```

#### Interactive - Kubernetes Fundamentals: Distilled JRE Apps in Containers

###### Covers how to strip down image size in newer versions of Java. Produce a customized JRE that is stripped down to the bare essentials based on the dependency needs of your application. 

https://github.com/Joxit/docker-registry-ui

decent web interface in front of your registry, solid and provides a clean interface



https://github.com/javajon/listdir

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javajon/listdir/master/src/main/java/org/dijure/lister/ListDir.java

simple application written in Java that lists the files from the current directory. 

```
./gradlew jar
```

The jar task creates an executable jar near 2600 bytes in size:

the size of the binary container image is about 184MB. This built image includes a Debian Linux OS, a JRE, and our ListDir application. The "slim" version is a derivation of Debian Linux that is smaller than the full Debian image. 

Let's switch to use Alpine an see the image size difference. the size of the binary container image is about 85MB.

use JLink to create a stripped-down, modularized JRE distribution and place that into an Alpine container

the size of the binary container image is now 39MB. Alpine is about 4.5MB, which means our app payload with the JRE is about 34MB

https://jamesward.com/2020/05/07/graalvm-native-image-tips-tricks/

With GraalVM the size of the binary container image is now down to just 25MB

#### Interactive - Spring Boot: Using the Command Line Runner Interface

The command line runner is an interface with a single method, `run(String... args)`, that you can use to indicate that a bean should run when it is contained within a Spring application. This method will be executed after the application context is loaded and right before the Spring application `run()` method is completed.
